===== Saving Snapshots

In order to save a snapshot of a given graph of entities, you need to call the `EntitySnapshotService.createSnapshot()` method passing the entity which is an entry point to the graph and the <<views,view>> describing the graph. The snapshot will be created using the loaded entities without any calls to the database. As a result, the snapshot will not contain the fields that are not included in the view used to load the entity.

The graph of Java objects is converted into XML and saved in the *SYS_ENTITY_SNAPSHOT* table (corresponding to the `EntitySnapshot` enitity) together with the link to the primary entity.

Usually, snapshots need to be saved after editor screen commit. This may be achieved by creating the listener the `onAfterCommitChanges` of the <<screen_controllers,screen controller>>, for example:
